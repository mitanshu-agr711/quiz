            <li> Each question will have a designated time limit for you to respond. Once the time is up, your answer
                will
                be automatically submitted.</li>
            <li>To move to the next question, click the <b>"Next" button</b>. You cannot proceed to the next question
                without
                selecting an answer or choosing to skip the current question.</li>
            <li> If you want to skip a question and come back to it later, use the <b>"Skip" button</b>. You can return
                to skipped
                questions as long as there's time left in the quiz.</li>
            <li> For multiple-choice questions, make sure to select only one option as your answer. Selecting multiple
                options for a single question is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Your score will be calculated based on your performance. You will receive <b>+5 points</b> for each
                correct answer
                and a deduction of <b>-1 point</b> for each incorrect answer. There is no penalty for skipped questions
