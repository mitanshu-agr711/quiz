            <li> Each question will have a designated time limit for you to respond. Once the time is up, your answer

            <li>To move to the next question, click the <b>"Next" button</b>. You cannot proceed to the next question
                without

            <li> If you want to skip a question and come back to it later, use the <b>"Skip" button</b>. You can return

                questions as long as there's time left in the quiz.</li>

                options for a single question is not allowed.</li>
